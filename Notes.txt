Make 2 selects.
Make search bar and select separate from each other.
Worry about connecting later.
In the selects, instead of directors, change it to types/weaks.
Could type them all out or make a helper page.
Filmspage assignment strong template.
Can store things typed into box in State.
Use this storage to make filter. Will have an array of all pokemon, then using what the user types, filter array down to
what should be displayed on page. .includes()
Use react-project as template for the search bar.
